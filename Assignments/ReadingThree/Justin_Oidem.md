# Reading Three 

I think that Trump hiring a Singaporean teenager through online marketplace Fiverr to convert a PowerPoint into a Prezi is quite hilarious. 
He is this man who wants to bring back work to Americans by stop US companies from outsourcing labor to other and cheaper countries. He 
built a whole platform of this basis. So I think the inclusion of this in this writing is necessary. It shows what kind of world we currently
live in. 

This raises questions as to the type of labor I will be doing in the future. As we are moving to an evermore digital age where almost everything
is done via computers is there a need for physical contact when it comes to these types of labor? We can technically just post jobs on these 
marketplaces and hire a random assortment of people. We can pick and choose whicheveer ones we prefer and it would probably be for a relatively
cheap cost. 

I think one of the questions brought up isn't really that important. When we are talking about places like Fiverr, I don't think making the
distinction between software and people really matters. There is no physical contact. You are engaging in some sort of contract with another 
person via internet. They complete the task given to them and then they are compensated. It is as simple as that. You don't have to think
much of the person who is on the other end. I think this only matters though for this given situation. I think there will be many situations 
where it would matter when making the distinction. For example, if you wanted to present work by a certain person like a artist, you would
want to make that distinction whether the person you are talking to is a piece of software or a actual real human being.
