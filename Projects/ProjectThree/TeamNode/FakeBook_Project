FakeBook Project
	For this final collaborative project, the work amongst our group was divided. Since there was six of us in the group, three pairs consisting of two people where made. My partner was Michael Yue and we were in charge of creating a fake social media page. Since Facebook is the most used page, in terms of easy access with email confirmation, our group decided to use a replica of this application. 
	The original idea behind this project was to create a local hotspot with similar characteristics to a real Wi-fi hotspot but with a twist, a “fake” browser capable of allowing those using it, to access from a range of search engines, and news websites, to personal pages. Michael and I were in charge of replicating the facebook page, along with fake error pages that would appear after the users had already accessed all the pages created.
	While creating the FakeBook page, our intention was to create a familiar style from the real page, however we included our twist that showed obvious fake qualities. The users of this page where exposed to other capabilities not allowed in the original facebook, this ranged from built-in dating applications to access of those that don’t want to be friends with the user. The images and logos were modified and recreated to create the content desired. In conclusion, this project was created to bring awareness to the users about internet censorship. Through several modifications in the index page, we were able to “hack” the original facebook, to show our original message.
